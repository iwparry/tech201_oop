# Tech 201 Object-Oriented Programming
## What is Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)?
**Object-Oriented Programming**, or simply OOP, is a programming model based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.
Everything in OOP is an object and objects are modelled against real world objects.
Take a car for example, a car is an object, and it possesses several attributes such as colour, style, make. A car also exhibits several behaviours such as accelerate, brake, steer.
In OOP we model our "objects" in the same way.
### Classes
Of course in OOP we need a way to create our objects, fortunately we have a way to make a template that we use to create objects, we do this via **classes**.
As said previously classes are templates that we use in order to create objects.
Classes are a way of bringing both data and functionality of our code together. So how do we create a class?
```python
class ClassName: # how we create a class
    pass # classes require indentation like functions etc.
```
